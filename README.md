# ALG

This project allows the user to preform all the basic python integer related programs.

The basic principal of the program is to make self made modules for the feature which are to be included by using basic python functions and mathematical operators.

The main purpose of this program is to learn and practice making and importing self made modules in python while also making something remotely usefully.

In the future more complex functions will be included.
